Best First Search can be thought of as someone who always chases the goal in the straightest possible way, using only "how close am I to the target?" as their guide. This makes it very quick because it doesn’t think too much—it just goes wherever the goal looks nearer. But just like a person rushing towards a destination without checking for obstacles, it might get stuck or end up taking a longer route than necessary. So, it’s fast but not always smart.

A* Search, on the other hand, behaves more like a careful planner. It not only looks at how close the goal is, but also remembers how much effort it has already spent getting there. This way, it balances speed with caution, ensuring that it always finds the best (shortest) possible path if one exists. The trade-off is that A* can take more time and use more memory than Best First Search. In simple words: Best First is like running straight towards the finish line and hoping for the best, while A* is like checking your GPS and choosing the most efficient route, even if it takes a little longer.
